Scriptname SLOVE_NpcVoice Hidden
{The female-NPC beat DECISION, as one pure table: act + measurements in,
 (A-name category, B-folder debugtext) out. Extracted from SLOVE_Voice so the
 dispatch reads as data and the engine keeps only the play step - the caller
 owns every stateful input (her PPA reading, the intensity pick, the victim
 flag, the comment-chance knob) and plays the returned pick through its own
 PlaySound. A-name/debugtext pairs are the ones the PC's own dispatch uses for
 the same folders, so an A/stock slot degrades the same way hers does.}

;Decide the beat for one female NPC line.
;  act            - her side of the act (SLOVE_Voice.ResolveSpeakerAct):
;                   [0] dir giv/rcv/"", [1] place, [2] implement
;  intense        - her pool intensity (measured depth, else the scene beat)
;  ctx            - her PPA context bitmask (0 = none measured)
;  victim         - she is the coerced party (SexLab flag or Aggressive ctx)
;  compositionGrunt - unmeasured bystander in a scene with a penetrator:
;                   the plausible-grunt rule decided by the caller
;  commentChance  - fraction of beats allowed to be full SPOKEN lines; a
;                   failed roll falls to the non-verbal beat, never silence
;Returns String[2]: [0] = A-name category, [1] = B-folder debugtext.
