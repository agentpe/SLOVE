# Voice overlays - slots & routing reference

SLO VE's voice **content** lives in four additive overlays under **`Data\SKSE\Plugins\AudioUtil\config\`**: every `[[slot]]`, the actor→slot routing tables, the category maps, and the SFX slot. They are split by what they hold, so the routing layer can be read on its own:

| File | Holds |
|---|---|
| `SLOVE_creatures.toml` | creature slots C0-C41 and the `[race_map]` hints that route them |
| `SLOVE_female.toml` | female slots: the PC slot `F1`, the gag pool `F1gag`, the stock voices `F0`/`F0B`/`F0v2`-`F0v8`, and the NPC pool `F2`-`F10` |
| `SLOVE_male.toml` | male slots: the bundled packs `M1`-`M8` and the stock moan slots `M0`-`M0D` |
| `SLOVE_voices.toml` | no slots - the actor->slot routing, the category maps, the group volumes and the `SFX0` slot |

They merge in sorted filename order (`c` < `f` < `m` < `v`), then any voicepack's `SLOVE_zpack_*.toml` last. No slot id is shared between them, so the split is purely additive and the order among the four does not matter. This page documents all of them together.

It is an **additive overlay**. AudioUtil loads the base `AudioUtil.toml` first, then merges every `config\*.toml` on top in sorted filename order. Everything on this page is additive and merges across files — you can put your own version of any of it in [your own overlay](../packs/female.md#keeping-your-edits-across-updates).

Live reload (also rescans folders):

```
au reload
```

!!! note "Conventions"
    - All keys and names are **normalised** — lowercased, non-alphanumerics stripped.
    - Paths are **Data-relative** and written as TOML literal strings (single quotes) so backslashes need no escaping: `'Sound\fx\SLOVE\F1'`.
    - This preset sets **no `voice_root` / `sfx_root`** — every path is written out in full, so nothing depends on a shared root global.

## Slot resolution tables

These decide **which slot an actor speaks**. Evaluated in the order below; first hit wins. (The player is decided before all of them by `pc_female_slot` / `pc_male_slot` in [`AudioUtil.toml`](audioutil.md).)

### `[npc_overrides]`

Pin one specific NPC to one slot. Beats everything else.

```toml
[npc_overrides]
'MyFollower.esp|000D62' = "F2"
'MyEslMod.esp|D62'      = "F3"    # ESL-flagged: last 3 hex digits
```

Key format is `'Plugin.esp|FormID'`. May target any slot, including a PC-reserved one. Ships empty (one commented example).

### `[voicetype_remap]`

Renames a voicetype to one you have a pack for, **before** the slot lookup. Values are voicetype names — a single hop, so the target must itself be a `[voicetype_map]` key.

```toml
[voicetype_remap]
enable = true
MaleGuard = "MaleNord"
MaleCommander = "MaleBrute"
```

`enable = false` disables the entire layer, so only exact `[voicetype_map]` matches get voices.

**Shipped remaps:** `MaleCommander`/`MaleSoldier`/`MaleOldGrumpy` → MaleBrute · `MaleCommoner`/`MaleCommonerAccented`/`MaleEvenTonedAccented`/`MaleYoungEager`/`MaleDrunk`/`MaleOldKindly` → MaleEvenToned · `MaleElfHaughty`/`MaleWarlock`/`MaleSlyCynical` → MaleCondescending · `MaleGuard`/`MaleNordCommander` → MaleNord · `MaleDarkElfCynical` → MaleDarkElf · `MaleKhajiitAccented` → MaleKhajitt.

### `[voicetype_map]`

VoiceType → slot. A value may be a **single slot** or a **list**; with a list, actors sharing the voicetype spread across the slots deterministically by form id (the same NPC always gets the same slot).

```toml
[voicetype_map]
MaleEvenToned = "M1"
MaleBandit = ["M3", "M4"]
FemaleEvenToned = ["F2", "F3"]    # add your own female routing
```

**Shipped:** `MaleEvenToned`→M1, `MaleArgonian`→M2, `MaleBrute`→M3, `MaleNord`→M4, `MaleBandit`→[M3,M4], `MaleCondescending`→M5, `MaleDarkElf`→M6, `MaleKhajitt`→M7, `MaleOrc`→M8. **No female voicetypes are mapped by default** — unrouted females fall through to `default_female_slot` (`F0`, the stock moans).

### `[race_map]`

Race → slot, used when no voicetype matches. Hints are **substring-matched against the race editor id, longest hint first**, so `Werewolf` beats `Wolf` and `Troll` covers `TrollFrostRace`.

```toml
[race_map]
Nord = "M4"
Werewolf = "C1"
```

**Shipped:** `Argonian`→M2, `Nord`→M4, `DarkElf`→M6, `HighElf`→M5, `Khajiit`→M7, `Orc`→M8, plus the creature hints `Werewolf`→C1, `Draugr`→C2, `Falmer`→C3, `Troll`→C4, `Giant`→C5, `Wolf`→C6, `Dog`/`Husky`→C7, `Chaurus`→C8, `Spriggan`→C9, `Horse`→C10.

!!! note
    `Draugr` does not match skeleton races — add `Skeleton = "C2"` if you want them covered. `Husky` is listed separately because `DLC1HuskyRace` doesn't contain "Dog".

## Category layer tables

These decide **which folder a category name resolves to**, once the slot is known. Split by sex; `sex = "all"` slots use the **male** tables (that's where the creature/neutral fallbacks are authored) and skip `[male_only_remap]`.

### `[category_aliases]`

Script/property name → on-disk folder name. Applied when the exact folder doesn't exist.

```toml
[category_aliases.female]
TeaseMaleCloseToOrgasmIntense = "Male Close Tease Intense"
TeaseMaleCloseToOrgasmSoft = "Male Close Tease Soft"
MCMSampleSounds = "Orgasm"
Licking = "Blowjob Action"        # degrade: a B pack without a Licking folder plays its own oral SFX
LickingIntense = "Licking"        # act first, intensity via the fallback below
LickingComments = "Blowjob Comments"
LickingForced = "Blowjob Forced"
Rimjob = "Licking"                # rimjob degrades to the pack's cunnilingus pools first
RimjobIntense = "Rimjob"
RimjobComments = "Licking Comments"
RimjobForced = "Licking Forced"

[category_aliases.male]
StrugglingOvert = "Struggling Early"
JokeAroused = "Joke After Orgasm"
TeaseFemaleOrgasm = "Tease Aggressive Partner"
AfterFemaleOrgasm = "Post Nut Remark"
MCMSampleSounds = "Orgasm"
```

### `[male_only_remap]`

In a male-only scene the female engine's category names get routed to a male slot; this substitutes the closest male category. **Male slots only** (`sex = "all"` slots skip it). Full table: [Male-only scenes](../packs/categories.md#male-only-scenes-male_only_remap).

### `[category_fallbacks]`

Substitute (one hop) when a category has no folder in the slot. The substitute must resolve directly.

```toml
[category_fallbacks.female]
GreetLover = "Greet Familiar"
BreathySoft = "Breathy Intense"
Licking = "BlowjobActionSoft"   # A/stock slots: cunnilingus degrades to the old sound
LickingIntense = "Blowjob Action Intense"
LickingComments = "Blowjob Remarks"
LickingForced = "BlowjobActionSoft"
Rimjob = "BlowjobActionSoft"    # same terminal analogs as Licking*
RimjobIntense = "Blowjob Action Intense"
RimjobComments = "Blowjob Remarks"
RimjobForced = "BlowjobActionSoft"

[category_fallbacks.male]
Breathing = "Orgasm"     # creature ambience reuses the climax clips
Licking = "BlowjobActionSoft"   # male-routed cunnilingus degrades to stock male moans
LickingIntense = "BlowjobActionIntense"
LickingComments = "BlowjobActionSoft"
LickingForced = "BlowjobActionSoft"
Rimjob = "BlowjobActionSoft"    # male-routed rimjob: same degrade as Licking*
RimjobIntense = "BlowjobActionIntense"
RimjobComments = "BlowjobActionSoft"
RimjobForced = "BlowjobActionSoft"
```

Full female table: [Category Reference](../packs/categories.md#female-categories).

## `[groups]`

Startup volumes per audio group, `0.0–1.0`. **Startup only** — `voice.pcvolume`, `voice.partnervolume` and `sfx.volume` in `SLOVE.toml` override these at runtime.

```toml
[groups]
pc_high = 1.0
pc_low = 1.0
partner_high = 1.0
partner_low = 1.0
sfx = 1.0
oneshot = 1.0
```

| Group | Carries |
|---|---|
| `pc_low` / `pc_high` | the player's voice (soft / intense lines) |
| `partner_low` / `partner_high` | NPC partner voices |
| `sfx` | the body-SFX engine |
| `oneshot` | out-of-scene one-shots |

**How the low/high split is used.** The two lanes of a speaker share one volume — `voice.pcvolume` sets both `pc_low` and `pc_high`, and `voice.partnervolume` both `partner_*`. `low`/`high` is a **priority lane, not a loudness difference**: normal moans and chatter play on `_low`, while climax/orgasm cries play on `_high`. SLO VE uses that split to shape a scene automatically — it **ducks `pc_low` while an NPC is speaking** so the player's mundane lines don't muddy the partner's, and **at scene end it stops the `_low` buses immediately but lets the `_high` buses ring out for a short grace** so an in-flight orgasm cry can finish. None of this is configurable — the only dials you set are the two volumes in [`SLOVE.toml`](slove.md#volume).

## `[[slot]]`

One table per voice. Keyed by `id` — **if two files define the same id, the last one wins the whole slot** (no per-category merge).

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | The slot id used everywhere else (`"F1"`, `"M3"`, `"SFX0"`, or any name you like). |
| `sex` | string | `"female"`, `"male"`, or `"all"`. `"all"` matches either sex on an explicit route but is skipped by the blind default-by-sex fallback; it uses the male category tables. |
| `path` | path | Folder scanned for `<Category>\*.wav` subfolders. **Loose files only.** Optional if every category is explicit. |
| `fallback` | slot id | Categories this slot can't resolve are retried in that slot, per category. Chains allowed, **capped at 4 hops**. |
| `gag_slot` | slot id | Slot to use instead while the actor wears a gag device. |
| `[slot.categories]` | table | Explicit per-category audio — **wins over a same-named scanned folder**. |

### `[slot.categories]`

Two value forms:

```toml
[[slot]]
id = "F0"
sex = "female"
[slot.categories]
# string = one FOLDER scanned for this category.
#   'Sound\...' = full Data path; anything else = relative to the slot's `path`.
#   Loose files only. Several categories may share one pool.
Satisfied = 'Sound\fx\SexLab\vFemaleMoan01\mild'

# array = an explicit FILE LIST. Needs no folders on disk and MAY POINT INTO A BSA.
Orgasm = [
  'Sound\fx\SexLab\vFemaleMoan01\hot\hot_moans_01.wav',
  'Sound\fx\SexLab\fxOrgasm01\01.wav',
]
```

### The shipped slots

| Slot | File | Sex | Definition |
|---|---|---|---|
| `F1` | female | female | scans `Sound\fx\SLOVE\F1`, `fallback = "F0"`, `gag_slot = "F1gag"` |
| `F2`-`F10` | female | female | the NPC pool: stubs scanning `Sound\fx\SLOVE\F2`..`F10` (normally empty), `fallback` round-robin over `F0v2`..`F0v8`, `gag_slot = "F1gag"`; a voicepack replaces the id it claims |
| `F1gag` | female | female | scans `Sound\fx\SLOVE\F1gag`: one `GagMoan` pool, **no fallback** |
| `F0` | female | female | ~50 category folder-refs into SexLab's `vFemaleMoan01` (mild/medium/hot) + explicit `Orgasm` and blowjob-action lists |
| `F0B` | female | female | the same mapping over SexLab's `vFemaleMoan03` |
| `F0v2`-`F0v8` | female | female | the same mapping over `vFemaleMoan02`..`08` (05/06/08 ship no `hot`, so their climax categories use `medium`), `fallback = "F0B"` |
| `M1`-`M8` | male | male | scan `Sound\fx\SLOVE\M1`..`M8`, `fallback` round-robin over `M0`/`M0B`/`M0C`/`M0D` |
| `M0`-`M0D` | male | male | non-verbal categories only, folder refs into SexLab's `vMaleMoan01`..`04` |
| `C0`-`C10` | creatures | all | explicit vanilla-BSA file lists, `Orgasm` + usually `Breathing`; `C0` is the catch-all |
| `C11`-`C41` | creatures | all | 31 more species, same construction, `fallback = "C0"` (fox and dragon need More Nasty Critters) |
| `SFX0` | voices | all | ~50 folder refs into `Sound\fx\SloveSFX` (+ `Smack`, `PullOutGape` from `Sound\fx\SLOVE\Sounds`) |

Details per family: [Female packs](../packs/female.md) · [Male, creature, gag & SFX slots](../packs/slots.md).

## `[sfx]`

A flat `name = 'folder'` table, checked **after** the sfx slot's categories. SLO VE's preset defines everything as `SFX0` categories instead, so this table ships empty — it exists for add-ons that want to contribute a sound name without redefining the slot:

```toml
[sfx]
MyCustomSlap = 'Sound\fx\MyMod\slap'
```

A `[sfx]` name is also the **last resort** of voice-category resolution, so a body-SFX name can double as a voice category where that makes sense (which is how `Smack` and `PullOutGape` are reachable from the voice engine).

## Worked example — a complete custom slot

```toml
# Data\SKSE\Plugins\AudioUtil\config\ZZ_MyVoices.toml

[npc_overrides]
'Serana.esp|002B6C' = "Serana"      # pin her to a slot of her own

[[slot]]
id = "Serana"
sex = "female"
path = 'Sound\fx\SLOVE\Serana'       # <Category>\*.wav lives here
fallback = "F0B"                    # anything the pack lacks → stock moans
gag_slot = "F1gag"

[[slot]]
id = "Serana"                       # ← WRONG: a second block with the same id
                                    #    replaces the whole slot above
```

Then:

```
au reload
SLOVE_Test AuditVoicePack Serana
SLOVE_Test SampleCategory Serana Orgasm
```
